# Scratch AI

Connecting multiple Artificial Intelligence, Chat-bots, TTS, Speech-Recognition abilities to Scratch programming language.

Working with 5 layers:

## Layer 1 - Talk
The simplest layer. Connecting quality Text-To-Speech abilities to Scratch in the form of a "Talk" block.

## Layer 2 - Listen
Connecting Speech recognition features to Scratch, using events and "listen" blocks. Planning to use Annyang STT API.

## Layer 3 - Message
Connecting Scratch to messaging apps like Facebook Messenger, Viber or Slack. This will be done using a REST server, and the Scratch client will
connect through the server.

## Layer 4 - Understand
Connecting Scratch to deep-learning text analysis APIs, like Aylien and indico.io, to provide advanced text and image processing abilities.

## Layer 5 - Converse
Connecting Scratch to advanced personal assistant APIs, like api.ai, Cleverbot, etc.

This is a project for the hackathon.ai in Tel Aviv, 06-07.07.17. Any commits before that date are just experiments with different APIs we want
to integrate into our project.
